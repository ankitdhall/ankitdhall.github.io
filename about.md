I am **Ankit Dhall**, a computer science undergrad in my senior year, studying at VIT University. My interests lie at the intersection of Computer Vision, AI and Robotics.

I had the opportunity of working under [Prof. James Davis](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~davis/) and [Rajan Vaish](https://stanford.edu/~rvaish/), where we worked towards improving crowdsourcing by [prosposing a strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07543) that integrates the machine system with the crowd-sourcing platform. We show how providing images in a particular order to the crowd can provide a speed-up of more than 2x.

In the summer of 2016, I spent time as a research intern at [Prof. Wolfram Burgard's](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~burgard/) [Autonomous Intelligent Systems (AIS)](http://ais.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/index_en.php) research group in the lovely town of Freiburg, Germany. I worked on the [AdapNet](http://ais.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/publications/papers/valada17icra.pdf) that intelligently fuses RGB and depth images to provide robust semantic segmentation for both indoors as well as outdoors and employs our novel self-adapting deep learning architecture, [Convoluted Mixture of Deep Experts (CMoDE)](http://ais.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/publications/papers/valada16irosws.pdf). We used this to run autonomous driving experiments for several kilometers in the forest.

I am currently a research intern at [IIIT-Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) at [Prof. Madhava Krishna's](http://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~mkrishna/index.html) [Robotics Research Center (RRC)](http://robotics.iiit.ac.in/).
